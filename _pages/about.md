My name is Rami Hamada, and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin.

I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant in the Advanced Robotic Technologies for Surgery (ARTS) Laboratory. My work involves building and integrating hardware and software systems for medical robotics and sensing applications. This has included robotic teleoperation, sensor fabrication, embedded control, and software tools for system testing and integration.

I am interested in sensing systems, particularly the design and fabrication of novel sensors and their integration into robotic or embedded platforms.

This site is a collection of projects that reflect the types of problems I have worked on and the tools I used to solve them.
