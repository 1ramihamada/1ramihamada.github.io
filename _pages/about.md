My name is Rami Hamada, and I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin.

I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant in the Advanced Robotic Technologies for Surgery (ARTS) Laboratory, where I build and integrate hardware–software systems for medical robotics and sensing applications. My work has included robotic teleoperation, sensor fabrication, embedded control, and software tools for interacting with physical systems.

I’m especially interested in sensing systems—how sensors are designed, fabricated, and integrated into larger robotic or embedded platforms—and in the signal processing and software needed to make those systems reliable and useful. I enjoy working across the stack, from hardware integration and low-level control to higher-level software and visualization.

This site is a collection of projects that reflect the kinds of problems I enjoy working on and the tools I use to solve them.
